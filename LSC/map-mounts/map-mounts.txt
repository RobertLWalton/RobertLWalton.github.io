The Map Mount is:
    10x2 dimensional pressure-treated lumber cut to 16" nominal length,
    with two centered 3/8" mounting holes exactly 13" apart, painted
    with brown Cabot Solid Acrylic Stain.  The board weight is 4.29 lb
    if the lumber is pressure treated Southern Yellow Pine.  Also see
    Map Board Manufacture below.

Recommended Mounting Fasteners:
    3/8" lag bolt, length 3", 3 1/2", or 4" hot dipped galvanized
    3/8" washer, hot dipped galvanized
    3/8" lock washer, hot dipped galvanized

Recommended Mounting Method:
    Use just the top mounting hole.  Drill a lead hole first to the
    depth that the lag screw will penetrate the tree (1 1/2" - 2").  Drill
    sizes are 3/16" for evergreen (soft wood) trees and 1/4" for
    deciduous (hard wood) trees.

    Use 3 1/2" or 4" long bolts unless tree bark is thin.

    Use a regular washer next to the board and a lock washer between
    the regular washer and the bolt head.  Tighten bolt so lock washer
    is only very slightly compressed.  This will allow for 1 year
    typical tree growth (1/14" to 1/10"), the difference between a
    slightly compressed and a fully compressed lock washer.  Check and
    adjust once or twice a year.  Note that the lock washer is not used
    as it normally would be, but is instead used as a spring.

Tools:
	cordless screwdriver/drill
	1/4" drill bit (for 2" long 3/8" lag bolt lead hole)
	3/16" drill bit (for 2" long 3/8" lag bolt lead hole)
	9/16" bolt magnetic driver bit (for 3/8" lag bolts)
	9/16" ratcheting combination wrench (for 3/8" lag bolts)

Notes:
  * The board is about 4 lb with a center of gravity 6.5" below the
    top mounting hole.  Pendulum action is resisted by (1) the lock
    washer slightly pressing the board into the tree, (2) friction
    between the lag bolt shank and the sides of the wooden mounting
    hole, but this may be unreliable, or (3) putting a second lag bolt
    through the bottom hole under the map in the unlikely case that
    all else fails.

Map Board Manufacture:
---------------------

    Cut boards from 2x10 pressure treated wood.  Avoid knots on sides
    of boards and in 3"x3" area at top and bottom where mounting holes
    will be.  One side of board should NOT have knots where map
    fasteners might be placed around perimeter of laminated map.

    Use a drill block or drill press to keep the two 3/8" holes
    perpendicular to the surface of the board.  Sand corners and
    edges, and paint.


Some Data That Might be Useful for Evaluation of Design:
-------------------------------------------------------

The screw length should account for 1 1/2" map board thickness,
1/2" bark and cambium layer (evergreen), 1/2" growth allowance
(includes washers), 1/4" bolt tip taper, total 2 3/4".  This
indicates that 3" bolts are too short unless bark is thin.

The board weight is about 1/8 x 3/4 x 4/3 = 1/8 cu ft x 34.34 lb/cu ft
(Southern Yellow Pine) = 4.49lb.

A 100 mph wind on the 3/4 x 4/3 = 1 sq ft face of the board generates
a force of 114 Newtons ~ 26 lb.  A 100 mph wind on the 1/8 x 4/3 =
1/6 sq foot side of the board generates about 4.33 lb.

NDS gives some guidance on the situation: see

    https://awc.org/codes-standards/publications/nds-2018
    Chapter 12: Dowel-Type Fasteners

Wood strength and hardness are measured by wood specific gravity G,
Table 12.3.3A.  For our kinds of trees, we have evergreen trees
G <= 0.41 (Eastern Spruce) and deciduous trees G >= 0.58 (Maple).
Our softest wood is G = 0.36 (Eastern White Pine).

Section 12.1.4 specifies lead hole sizes.

Table 12.2.A gives withdraw forces tolerated, which for our softest
wood (G = 0.36) is 186 lb per inch, so if the lag screw is embedded
in 1/2" of wood, the NDS withdraw force tolerated would be 93 lb.

To calculate NDS tolerated vertical sheer load we use the equations
of Table 12.3.1A with Fes set to infinity, and for short values of lm,
in our case 1/2", equation Im dominates.  As Rd <= 4, we have
Z = 1/4 x 3/8 x 1/2 x Fem = 3/64 x Fem, where Fem is F|| from Table
12.3.3, which for G = 0.36 is 4050 lb/sq-in, so the tolerated vertical
sheer is about (3/64)x4050 ~ 190 lb.

NDS is for kiln-dried wood with 19% moisture, and not for green wood,
but NDS has a large safety factor (x 3) that we do not need.

Bolts could be 3/8" or 1/4": both are mechanically sound.  Map board
need not be pressure-treated and could be Spruce Pine Fir.

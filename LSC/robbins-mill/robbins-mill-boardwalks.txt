Robbins Mill Boardwalks

Of the 3 boardwalks in Robbins Mill East, one (Boardwalk 3 below) requires
that its water channel be dug out every Fall.

The boardwalks are located here:

{"t":"Boardwalk%203","x":"-71.397291","y":"42.510140"}]

There are NO boardwalks in Robbins Mill West.

The original boardwalks were likely constructed in 2013, when the trails
were made.  Boardwalk 2 has screws attaching treads and has likely been
rebuilt; boardwalks 1 and 3 have nails.  All 3 boardwalks have 4x6
stringers.  Boardwalks 2 and 3 have longer than 8 foot sections, but
none longer than 10 feet.

Boardwalk 3 has two 10 foot sections, and the stream passes under one
of these.  The bottoms of the stringers on both sides of this section
are typically 1/4 inch under water.  This section appears to have collapsed
1-2 inches.  Mud and leaves build up on the upstream side of the section,
and block passage of water under the section.  This can cause flooding of
the boardwalk, and in Winter can cause icing of the boardwalk.

The short-term remedy is to dig out the mud and leaves every Fall.

Boardwalk 3 could be modified.  It has one sill between the sections.
This sill might be raised, and the section under which the stream passes
might be cut in two and a second sill added to raise the strings under
which water passes.
